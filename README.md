Pair Interaction of Active Colloid
Description:
My research focuses on the interaction of Janus colloidal particles in H2O2 solutions. I prepared solutions with varying H2O2 concentrations and recorded particle movement using an inverted microscope. I cropped and analyzed over 390 videos, using the TrackMate plugin in ImageJ to track particle movement and store positional data in Excel. I calculated key parameters, including the speed of small and large particles, the gap between them, and the collision times. A critical aspect of the research was examining the speed ratios and plotting comparative graphs. This study aimed to understand self-propulsion, Brownian motion, and interaction dynamics of Janus particles. The findings provide insights into their behavior in reactive environments, potentially informing applications in targeted drug delivery and nanotechnology.
